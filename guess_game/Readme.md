## Guess Game

In this game, two players send their guesses and the same amount of coins to the game object.

Once both players have submitted their guesses, a pseudo-random number is generated. The player whose guess is closest to the pseudo-random number wins all the coins. If the guesses are equally close to the pseudo-random number, both players get their coins back.
